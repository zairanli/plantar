Element extraction using plantar pressure imaging dataset.

The Foot-Scan imaging system can generate left and right foot pressure images at different times. To achieve successful image fusion, image preprocessing is a crucial step. Different fusion algorithms require appropriate preprocessing techniques. To accomplish this, background removal, dimensionality reduction, filtering, segmentation, and other tasks are necessary. The foot scan experiment involved 100 volunteers aged 18 or over. To participate in the plantar pressure imaging experiment, potential volunteers needed to have normal neurological functions without any related neurological diseases, no walking instability, abnormal gait, intermittent claudication, or blurred vision. Additionally, they had to have normal muscle strength and tendon reflexes, no severe foot pain conditions, and no foot ulcers. The volunteers completed relevant forms before providing medical data. They were asked to remove their socks and report their shoe-wearing habits, age, gender, height, weight, and blood pressure. During the test collection, volunteers walked at a normal speed for 10 repetitions. The plantar pressure imaging system divides the plantar into 10 anatomically-based divisions and provides measurement data (in discrete values), including medial, lateral, midfoot, five metatarsal bones, foot size big toe, and the other four toes.
